# Sensor Simulators #

You've ordered a sensor from Aliexpress but it's going to take a number of weeks before it turns up.

You don't like the drivers for it found on the internet so you've decided to write your own (Like I did).

Well, these could be the solution for you. They are sketches which simulate the sensors. Many are serial, some are PWM.
